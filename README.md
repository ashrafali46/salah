Windows 8 html &amp; javascript app to display islamic prayer times.

Notes from the author
-----------------------

I didn't choose to renew my Windows 8 developer license so the app will be unlisted in the coming month. 
Until then, [here's a link to the the store app page](http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/en-us/app/salah/44cc9755-4bf3-442c-9202-c8d3763b1dbf).

I did not intend to open source it, however, due to the above, decided otherwise. It is licensed under the MIT license, included below.
Salaam.
